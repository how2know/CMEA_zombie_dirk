# CMEA_zombie_dirk
## Description
C++ project realized for the course "Computational Methods for Engineering Application" given at ETH Zurich during the Fall Semester 2019.
## Aims of the course
The course gives an introduction to the numerical methods for the solution of ordinary and partial differential equations that play a central role in engineering applications. Both basic theoretical concepts and implementation techniques necessary to understand and master the methods will be addressed.
## Additional information
The material and template code were given and I (as a student) had to complete them in order to meet the instructions given in the file "project1_2019.pdf". The expected solution are given in the file "solution_project1_2019".
